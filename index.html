                image wizardry, we combine this the garment with images of models. <br /><br /> I worked on all kinds of things here, preprocessing of images, backend retouch tools, as well as the software used in the studio. At Looklet I started understanding
                dev pipelines, gained a minor interest in web development and grew my interpersonal skills.

                Using behavioral economics as a base, we run a lot of A/B tests to gain insights on behaviors and values, user testing of new feature ideas, as well as statistical analysis of existing data.<br /><br />My work here is very varied, working
                on everything from creating the membership system and payments, converting our CS backend system to react, to making fun slack bots and improve the deployment pipeline.
